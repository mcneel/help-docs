# Automate Rendering
 

The Flamingo nXt **Render Farm** uses the power of several computers to render single images, batch jobs of multiple images, or view-based animations. Neither Rhino nor Flamingo nXt is required on the computers that are used only as render farm clients.

## The Farm Process
 

When rendering using Flamingo nXt, instead of rendering a single image with the **Render** command, use the **Render Farm**  *(Flamingo nXt menu &gt; Render Farm)*. This will submit a render job to the [Farm output folder](../general/options-flamingo.html#farm-output-folder). All materials and support information will automatically be submitted along with the job.

The **Render Farm** clients continuously check the farm output folder for a new job. Each client will pick up a part of the job and start to render. The **Farm Monitor**  *(Flamingo nXt &gt; Utilities &gt; Farm Monitor)* keeps track of the job's progress.

Each farm client deposits the results in the farm folder under &lt;&lt; *job name* &gt;&gt;\Output.

Farm output will be in the [nXt image format (.nXtImage)](image-editor.html). Images in this format can be edited using the [nXt Image Editor](image-editor.html). The results can also be saved as TGA, PNG, TIF, and JPG files from the [nXt Image Editor](image-editor.html).

As each client finishes with a job, it will continue to pick up new jobs as they are submitted to the farm.

The Render Farm is free for up to two client computers. To add additional client computers, purchase the **nXt Render Farm** license from [https://www2.mcneel.com/commerce/accurender/buy-farm.asp](https://www2.mcneel.com/commerce/accurender/buy-farm.asp).

The **nXt Render Farm** includes two parts:

 * nXtFarmer.exe (nXtFarmer64.exe)
A small program that runs on each network rendering client and waits for jobs to be generated. Normally, render farms proceed silently without displaying the renderings on a monitor as they progress. Rendering in this manner allows you to use more computer power for lengthy tasks but does not allow interacting with the rendering as it progresses.

 * nXtFarmMonitor.exe (nXtFarmMonitor64.exe)
An applet that shows you the state of your render jobs and provides some simple control tools.

For advanced installations, the nXt Render Farm software lets you work with third-party render managers. The following procedures apply to the Render Farm included with Flaming nXt. If you are planning to use third-party render farm software, some of these procedures will be different.


#### To configure the Render Farm

 * Create a folder to store the Render Farm jobs on a common shared location.
This folder can be on a network server machine or any location that all farm computers can access. All of the farm client computers must have read/write access to this folder. The shared folder should have at least 20GB of available storage.

You must perform the following four steps on all computers you plan to use in the Render Farm, including any nXt workstations that will submit jobs to the render farm:

1.

Install the **nXt Render Farm** software.

2.

From the **Start** menu, run the **Render Farmer** on each machine.

The **Render Farmer** will appear as an icon in the system tray.

3.

 [Right-click](../mouse-button-right.html) on the icon and select **Restore**.

4.

In the **nXt Farmer** window, on the **Options** menu, click **Path** and select the path to the **Render Farm** folder.

 * On the computer with Rhino and Flamingo nXt where you will ready the models to render and submit jobs to the farm, in Rhino, from the **Tools** menu, click **Options**, set the common farm location to the [Farm output folder](../general/options-flamingo.html#farm-output-folder).
The Render Farm is now configured.


#### To verify that the client workstations are responding

 * On any of the client workstations, on the **Windows Start** menu, click **Render Farmer**.
The client machines should appear in the upper list box.


## Using the Render Farm
 

Currently, the farm can be used three ways for processing renderings on multiple computers: single rendering jobs, batch jobs, and animations.


## Single Images
 

When rendering single images, each image is split into &quot;slices&quot; and distributed to multiple computers.

The progress of jobs can be viewed with the [Farm Monitor](automate-rendering.html#render-farm-monitor). As soon as the job is sent, another farm job may be submitted. Newly submitted jobs will queue up in the render farm shared folder. By default, the farm will render the jobs in the order they were received.

To reconstruct the output into a single image, use the [nXt Image Editor, Arithmetic](image-editor.html#arithmetic) function.


#### To submit a single image job to the render farm

1.

In Rhino, configure your rendering and view as you would for a normal rendering.

2.

On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Render Farm**.


## Farm Job Options
 


### Name
 

The date and time is automatically pre-pended to the name you choose. A sub-folder for the job is created in the **Render Farm** shared folder. An output folder is also created in the new job folder.

After each job is complete, output can be found in the job's output folder.


### Start job


#### Now

Start the job now.


#### Later (Manually)

Start the job later using the nXt Render Farm Monitor to start the job.


#### After

Start the job at a specified date and time.


### Render constraints


####  [Passes](documentproperties-flamingo.html#number-of-passes) 


## Batch Jobs
 

Batch jobs let you submit multiple jobs and views to the Render Farm with one command. Each batch rendering will be rendered by a single client computer.


#### To submit a batch job to the render farm

1.

In Rhino, configure your rendering and view as you would for a normal rendering.

2.

On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Render Batch**.


## Batch Render Options
 


### Add
 

Add a viewport to the batch list.


### Remove
 

Delete a viewport from the batch list.


### Properties
 

Set the [Batch Render Properties](automate-rendering.html#batch-render-properties).


### Move Up

## Licensing the Render Farm
 

The free version of the Render Farm allows two network computers (nodes) to work on jobs simultaneously. If you wish to have more network nodes running simultaneously, you can purchase an unlimited node license from [https://www2.mcneel.com/commerce/accurender/buy-farm.asp](https://www2.mcneel.com/commerce/accurender/buy-farm.asp).

Once you have purchased your license and have acquired a product key, use the following procedures to license your farm.


#### To authorize the node

1.

Wait for any active farm jobs to complete before beginning your licensing.

2.

Save your **Product Key** to a text file on a network location so you can easily cut and paste it into each node.

3.

If the node is currently active, in the Windows system tray (on the taskbar), **/mouse_button_right.htm');" id="a16" style="position: relative;">right-click** the **Render Farm** icon, and then click **Close**.

4.

Click the **Windows Start** button, and then click **All Programs**.

In the **nXt Render Farm** folder, click **Authorize Farm**.

5.

In the edit box, paste or type your **Product Key** and click **OK**.
