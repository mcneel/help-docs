# Image Editor
 

The nXt Image Editor can edit native image files (.nXtImage) produced by any of the nXt platforms. These native files retain all of the information gathered during rendering.

Using the nXt Image Editor, you can:

 * Adjust the [tone operator](image-editor.html#tone-mapping) settings.
 * Change the intensity of any lighting channel.
 * Add special image-based effects: [Haze](image-editor.html#haze), [Depth Blur](image-editor.html#depth-blur), and [Glare](image-editor.html#glare).
 *  [Save](image-editor.html#save-tonemapped-image-as) a tone-mapped image in a bitmap format such as .jpg or .png.
 * Save the luminance information to an [HDR format](image-editor.html#save-hdr-image-as).
 * View and save additional masked channels ( [alpha](image-editor.html#alpha-channel), [distance](image-editor.html#distance-channel), [material](image-editor.html#material-channel) ) for use in advanced compositing.
 * Save a [PiranesiÂ©](http://www.piranesi.co.uk/) file format (*.epx) which can be used to create non photo-realistic rendering.
 * Use Image [Arithmetic](image-editor.html#arithmetic) for tasks such as stitching together an image that has been generated by separate nodes on the render farm.
 * Save the [Lighting Settings](image-editor.html#save-lighting-settings-as) used to generate this rendering. These Lighting Settings can then be used to generate more renderings.

#### To launch the editor

 * On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Utilities &gt; Flamingo nXt Image Editor**.

### Save Mask
 

nXtImage files contain three additional channels that can be used as masks for advanced compositing in most bitmap editors. These channels carry alpha, distance, and material information for each pixel, encoded in a gray-scale image. Each channel can be viewed and saved to a .png file.


## Notes:
 

 * The alpha channel can be included with a tone-mapped image by selecting a file format with Alpha when saving a tone-mapped image.
 * Distance and Materials channels are not antialiased and may show some hard-edged artifacts. Adding a small amount of Gaussian blur to a mask before using it may help soften these edges.
 * The Materials channel will only uniquely encode 255 different materials. If your model contains more materials than that, some mask colors will repeat.

#### Material Channel

## Image menu
 


### Info
 

Displays information about the image.


### Arithmetic
 

Allows piecing together or overlaying segments of images rendered using the [Render Farm Single Image](automate-rendering.html#single-images) function.


#### To piece image segments

1.

On the **File** menu, click **Open**.

Select the first image of the sequence, for example, 000000.nXtImage.

2.

On the **Image** menu, click **Arithmetic**, and then click **Add**.

3.

Select all of the other images in the sequence.

 **Note** : Do not select the first image (000000.nXtImage) again or it will be added twice.


#### Add

Adds pixel values of one layer to the other. When values are above 255 (in the case of RGB), white is displayed.


#### Subtract

Subtracts pixel values of one layer from the other. When values are negative, black is displayed.


#### Difference

Subtracts the top layer from the bottom layer or the other way round, to always get a positive value. Blending with black produces no change, as values for all colors are 0. Blending with white inverts the picture.


#### Masked Add

Takes the transparent alpha-channel mask into account when blending.


#### Combine Path Tracings

Combines images rendered using the Path Tracer engine so that for example, combining ten images rendered with 20 passes each becomes the equivalent of an image rendered with 200 passes.


 *<img src="combinedpathtrace200.png"/> *Rendered with 20 passes (left), ten 20-pass images combined to create a 200-pass image (right).* * 

### Apply Patch
 

Inserts an image rendered as a selected portion into the rendered image.


### Animation
 

You can animate changing the image information.


#### To animate image effects

1.

Set up the first image.

&#160;

Click the **Plus (+)** button next to the **Frame** edit box.

2.

## Tone mapping
 

Tone mapping is the process of converting the luminance data used by nXt into&#160;RGB pixels that can be displayed or printed.


## Tone mapping controls
 


### Brightness
 

See [Render Window: Brightness](render-window.html#brightness).

 **Note** : In nXt, the overall brightness of a scene cannot be controlled by boosting the intensity of the light sources. The automatic exposure adjustment built into the tone-mapping process will defeat this. Adjust overall scene brightness by using the **Brightness** control.


### Burn
 

See [Render Window: Burn](render-window.html#burn) 


### Saturation
 

See [Render Window: Saturation](render-window.html#saturation) 


### Histogram
 

See [Render Window: Histogram](render-window.html#histogram) 


## Status Fields
 

The status fields are located at the bottom of the screen. As you move your cursor over the image, these fields display information about each pixel.


### Pixel
 

The pixel coordinate, measured from the lower left corner.


### Color
 

The first three fields display the RGB colors&#160;displayed in the image after tonemapping. The fourth field shows the alpha (transparency) channel, which is used for compositing.


### Value
 

The luminance value for each of the red, green, and blue sub-channels.


### Lum
 

A weighted average of the luminance values stored in each pixel.


### Depth
 

The distance of each pixel from the viewer in meters. Negative values indicate a background pixel.


### Material
 

The name of the material used to render the pixel.


## FX Settings
 


## Haze
 

Adds color to pixels farther from the camera. This effect can be used to add a haze or fog effect to a scene or to mask a background with color or change the background color.


 *<img src="golden gate.png"/>Original image (left) and with haze (right).* 

### Strength
 

Specifies the intensity of the haze color.


### Near
 

The distance from the camera where haze will start adding color to each pixel.


#### Pick

Pick a point on the image to specify the distance.


### Far
 

The distance at which the haze effect will be its maximum.&#160;All pixels beyond this point will have the maximum haze effect added to each pixel.

Pixels between near and far will have haze added in a linear fashion from the near to the far pixels.


#### Pick

Pick a point on the image to specify the distance.


### Color
 

The haze color.


#### Pick

Pick a point on the image to specify the color.


## Depth Blur
 

Since each pixel in the image contains a distance value, this can be used to blur the image between specified distances.

<img src="fx-depth-001.png"/>


 *Original image (left) and with depth blur (right).* 

### Strength
 

Specifies the amount of blur.


### Focus
 

Specifies a distance in the image that will be in focus.


#### Pick

Pick a point on the image to specify the focus distance.


### In-Focus Zone
 

The distance around the **Focus** that is sharp.&#160;This value is in meters.&#160;All pixels within this distance will be sharp and will be ignored by the Blur filter.&#160;Pixels beyond this distance will be progressively blurred with neighboring pixels to give the illusion of depth of field.


### Blur
 

Controls which direction the blur filter will work.&#160;The default value is **Background** .&#160;This means all pixels farther away from the camera than the **In-Focus Zone** will progressively blur.


 *<img src="blur-001.png"/>Blur foreground (left) and background (right).* 

#### Background

Blurs pixels farther away from the camera than the **In-Focus Zone** range.


#### Foreground

Blurs pixels that are closer to the camera than the **In-Focus Zone** range.


#### Both

Blur pixels both in front and behind the **In-Focus Zone** range. This is a quick way to get a depth-of-field effect.&#160;It is not as accurate as using the built-in pre-render [Depth of Field](render-tab.html#depthoffieldoption).


## Glare
 

Glare affects pixels that are brighter than the Threshold in lumens by creating a halo effect on the surrounding pixels.&#160;Only the brightest pixels in the image are affected.

Hold the cursor over the pixels to see glare and read the total lumens of that pixel.


 *<img src="glare-001.png"/>Original image (left) and with glare (right).* 

### Strength
 

Adjusts the amount of halo that affects the surrounding pixels.


### Threshold
 

The lower limit of&#160;the&#160;value affected by the glare filter.&#160;All pixels brighter than this value will be affected.


#### Pick

Pick a point on the image to specify the brightness value.


## Vignette
 

Blurs and blends the colors on the edges of the image to create a halo effect.


 *<img src="fx-vignette-001.png"/>Original image (left) and with vignette (right).*
