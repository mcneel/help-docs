#### From the color selector

1.

Drag the marker around the wheel to define the hue.

2.

Drag the marker horizontally in the square to define the saturation level.

3.

Drag the marker vertically in the square to define the brightness value.


#### From the HSV and RGB boxes

1.

To select an red/green/blue (RGB) color, type values in the **R**, **G**, and **B** boxes.

2.

To create an hue/saturation/brightness value (HSV) color, type values in the **Hue**, **Sat**, and **Value** boxes.


### Red, Green, Blue (RGB)
 

This method is used by computers to project color onto the monitor. Each pixel is a combination of the three colors in varying intensities. Pure red is entirely red with no green or blue. Pure black has red, green, and blue set to 0, and pure white has red, green, and blue set to 255.


### Hue, Saturation, and Brightness (HSB)
 

Brightness is also sometimes referred to as luminance or value.


#### Hue

A color's hue corresponds to its visible wavelength of light. Hue is measured in degrees from 0 to 359, which correspond roughly with a rainbow's hues in 60 degree increments: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.


#### Saturation

Saturation refers to the color's intensity on a 0 to 100 scale. A saturation of 0 produces a neutral gray color that varies from black to white depending on the color's brightness. The hue has no effect on a color with a saturation component of 0. A saturation of 100 produces that hue's most intense shade.


#### Brightness

Brightness refers to the perceived amount of light value (or white) in the color. The brightness component varies between 0 and 100.
