# Getting Started with Flamingo nXt®
 

 **Flamingo nXt** creates high quality, photorealistic, still, and animation image files from 3-D models inside **Rhinoceros** ®.

For technical support, tutorials, examples, and information about how to get started using **Flamingo nXt**, go to the [Flamingo nXt web site](http://nxt.flamingo3d.com/).

 *  [Gallery](http://nxt.flamingo3d.com/photo) 
 *  [Technical Support](http://nxt.flamingo3d.com/forum) 

## The Flamingo nXt Control Panel
 

The **Flamingo nXt**  **Control Panel** provides tabs for setting up the model for rendering, including:

 *  [Materials](..\materials\materials-tab.html) 
 *  [Lighting](../lighting/lighting-tab.html) 
 *  [Environment](../environment/environment-tab.html) 
 *  [Render](../render/render-tab.html) 

## To access the Flamingo control panel
 

 * On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Control Panel**.

## Rendering Basics
 

Rendering your finished model comprises four basic steps:

 *  [Set up lighting](../lighting/lighting-tab.html) 
 *  [Set up materials](..\materials\materials-tab.html) 
 *  [Set up an environment](../environment/environment-tab.html) 
 *  [Set up rendering conditions](../render/render-tab.html) 

#### To start a rendering

 * On the **Render** or **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Render**.
- Or -

 * On the **Standard** toolbar, click the **Render** button.

### Stop Rendering
 

By default, the rendering process will continue refining the image, pass by pass, until you click the **Stop Rendering** button. This allows you to manage the trade-off between time and quality. The longer you allow the rendering to continue, the more closely it will resemble its fully converged &quot;correct&quot; result. You can stop a rendering at any time.


###  <kbd>Resume Rendering</kbd> 
 

Clicking the **Stop Rendering** button suspends the rendering process after the current pass is completed.

The button then changes to **Resume Rendering**. If you have stopped the rendering before the number of passes or the time constraints have been reached, you can click the **Resume Rendering** button to continue.

Use the [Number of passes](..\render\render-window.html#number-of-passes) or [Time](..\render\render-window.html#time) settings on the [Render Window](..\render\render-window.html) or in [Document Properties &gt; Flamingo nXt](..\render\documentproperties-flamingo.html) to set an automatic stopping point.
