# Plants

 *Flamingo nXt trees.* 
Flamingo nXt includes a fun and powerful plant generator that efficiently generates complex plant forms during rendering. These plants have little impact on model size, since only a placeholder is kept in the model.


#### Insert an nXt Plant

1.

On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Plants &gt; Insert Plant**.

2.

In the **Flamingo nXt Plant** dialog box, click a plant name, and click **Open**.

3.

At the prompt, pick a location for your plant in the model.


## Notes
 

 * Make sure the units are set correctly for your model.
 * Plants can be scaled, copied, and rotated.

#### Using Flamingo 2 plants

1.

On the **Flamingo nXt** menu, click **Plants &gt; Insert Flaming 2 Plant**.

2.

In the **Flamingo nXt Plant** dialog box, click a plant name, and click **Open**.

3.

At the prompt, pick a location for your plant in the model.


## Notes
 

 * Models with Flamingo 2 plants already inserted should work with some restrictions.
 * Flamingo 2 plants are different from the new plants. Currently you cannot edit Flamingo 2 plants or convert them to Flamingo nXt plants.
