# Lighting: Advanced
 


### Sun
 

The sun is a very bright directional light source infinitely far away from the model.


#### On/Off

Turns the sun on and off.

### Sky
 

Defines a hemispherical light source infinitely far away from the model.


#### Off

Turns the sky off.

#### Auto

Provides an analytical model based on real-world sky conditions. The settings on the [Sun](sun-and-sky-tabs.html) tab control the appearance and light qualities of the sky.

#### HDRi

An HDR image provides something for shiny objects to reflect.

#### Color

Sets the sky to a solid color or a two- or three-color gradient using controls similar to [Environment: Color and Gradient Backgrounds](../environment/environment-tab.html#color-and-gradient-backgrounds).

#### Image

Uses an image background with a planar, cylindrical, or spherical projection similar to [Environment: Image](../environment/environment-tab.html#image).

### Studio Brightness
 

Reduces the brightness of the [sun](sun-and-sky-tabs.html) and sky to mimic the interior lighting levels of a photographer's studio.

### Lights
 


#### On/Off

Turns artificial lighting on and off.

## Indirect
 

Defines the lighting reflected from surfaces. By default, it is on for interior lighting and off for exterior and studio lighting preset schemes. It is possible to turn on indirect lighting for exterior renderings.


#### Method

Sets the calculation method for indirect lighting.


#### Off

Turns indirect lighting calculation off.


#### Interior

Optimizes the indirect lighting for indoor situations.


#### Exterior

Optimizes the indirect lighting for outdoor situations.

Indirect lighting reflected from other surfaces, can add subtlety and realism to your exterior rendering. In particular, the undersides of overhanging features such as eaves or balconies render more accurately when using indirect lighting.


#### Bounces

Specifies the number of reflections caused by an indirect light.


#### Color Bleed

Specifies the amount of color transfer associated with each indirect bounce.


### Ambient
 

Ambient light is a constant light added to the rendering. These settings control&#160;the intensity of the ambient light as a percentage of the total estimated ambient light in the scene.

Decreasing the amount of ambient light generally produces images with more contrast. Too much ambient light can make a rendered image seem flat and uninteresting; too little can cause excessive contrast.


#### None

No ambient light.


#### Exterior

Optimizes ambient light for exterior scenes.


#### Interior

Optimizes ambient light for interior scenes.


#### Studio

Optimizes ambient light for studio scenes.


### Monte Carlo reflections
 

Tries to resolve blurry reflections containing small, bright areas. This is normally slower than the standard reflection algorithm. See: [Wikipedia article: Monte Carlo method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method).
