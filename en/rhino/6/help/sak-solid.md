# Solid objects
A solid is a surface or polysurface that encloses a volume. Solids are created anytime a surface or polysurface is completely closed. Rhino creates single-surface solids, polysurface solids, and extrusion solids.

## Draw single surface solids
A single surface can wrap around and join itself. Example commands include [Sphere](sphere.html), [Torus](torus.html), and [Ellipsoid](ellipsoid.html). Control points can be displayed on single-surface solids and moved to change the surface.

![images/ellipsoid.png](images/ellipsoid.png) [Ellipsoid](ellipsoid.html) 
Draw a solid ellipsoid.
![images/sphere.png](images/sphere.png) [Sphere](sphere.html) 
Draw a solid sphere.
![images/torus.png](images/torus.png) [Torus](torus.html) 
Draw a torus (donut shape).

## Draw polysurface solids
Some Rhino commands create polysurface solids. Apolysurfaceconsists of two or more surfaces that are joined together. A polysurface that encloses a volume of space defines a solid. [Pyramid](pyramid.html), [Cone](cone.html), and TCone are examples of commands that create polysurface solids.

The [SolidPtOn](pointson.html#solidpton) command turns on grip points for polysurfaces, which act like control points.

## Create solid object from curves or surfaces
![images/boss.png](images/boss.png) [Boss](boss.html) 
Extrude closed planar curves normal to the curve plane toward a boundary surface where the boundary surface is trimmed and joined to the extruded objects.
![images/extrudecrv.png](images/extrudecrv.png) [ExtrudeCrv](extrudecrv.html) 
Drive closed planar curves in a straight line.
![images/extrudesrf.png](images/extrudesrf.png) [ExtrudeSrf](extrudesrf.html) 
Drive surface edges in a straight line to create a solid.
![images/pipe.png](images/pipe.png) [Pipe](pipe.html) 
Create a [surface](rhinoobjects.html#surfaces), [polysurface](rhinoobjects.html#polysurfaces), or [extrusion](rhinoobjects.html#lightweightextrusions) object with a circular profile around a curve.
![images/rib.png](images/rib.png) [Rib](rib.html) 
Extrude a curve in two directions to a boundary surface.
![images/slab.png](images/slab.png) [Slab](slab.html) 
Offset a polyline, and extrude and cap the result to create a solid.
