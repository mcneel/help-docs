# VDA (.vda) import/export
VDA is a neutral file format defined by German association of automobile industries consortium for exchange of CAD data across systems.
VDAFS file supports representation of 3 D geometry and topology information. It does not support representation of drawing information, symbols, views, etc. It does not support assembly and feature information.
