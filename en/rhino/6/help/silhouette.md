To create two-dimensional curves from the silhouettes, use the [ProjectToCPlane](projecttocplane.html) command.

This visual edge is sometimes called the silhouette or horizon of the model.The silhouette direction is based on the current view. For example, if you look at a doughnut from the top, the silhouette is two circles. If you look at a doughnut from the side, the silhouette is an oval.Command-line options
