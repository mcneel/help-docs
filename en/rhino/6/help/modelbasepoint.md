The ModelBasepoint command sets a base point in a model that is used when inserting the model into another as a block definition.
Steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) a location.Notes:
By default the base point in any model is 0,0,0.TheModelBasepointcommand lets you set that point. The set base point has no effect in the current file, it is only a handle when inserting it into another Rhino model or when exporting.The [Export](export.html) and [ExportWithOrigin](export.html#exportwithorigin) commands use the current model as a template, so settingModelBasepointand other document settings such as [Model Units Document Properties](units.html) and [Grid Document Properties](grid.html) are copied to the new file.See also
