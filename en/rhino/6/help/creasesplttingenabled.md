Crease splitting enabled
When curves have [kinks](kink.html), surfaces made with those curves as input can have creases. TheCreaseSplittingcommand controls whether commands that make surfaces from kinked curves divide resulting surfaces into polysurfaces with edges at the creases or into single surfaces with creases.
When the input curve has a [kink](kink.html), the resulting surface will have a crease.
See: [CreaseSplitting](creasesplitting.html).
