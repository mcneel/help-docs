Isoparametric curve{: #kanchor3093}{: #kanchor3094}
An isoparametric curve (or isocurve) is a curve of constant u or v&#160;value on a surface. Rhino uses isocurves and surface edge curves to create a wireframe of the shape of a [NURBS](http://www.rhino3d.com/nurbs) surface. By default isocurves are drawn at [knot](knot.html) locations. If the surface is a single knot-span surface like a simple rectangular plane, isocurves are drawn also in the middle of the surface.
