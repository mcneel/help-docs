Create Point Cloud
The PointCloud command creates a set of vertices from selected point objects or a mesh object to facilitate selection and faster display.
The point cloud object type improves Rhino's performance when handling a large number of point objects imported from external files.
You can use the point cloud object to group any number of individual points into a single object, minimizing the amount of storage in the 3DM file and maintaining performance. You can snap and select points in the cloud as if they were just point objects. A point cloud is similar to a mesh object that does not display any wires between vertices.
