The ExportBitmaps command creates files from wallpaper and background bitmaps that are saved in the model.
TheExportBitmapscommand will save any bitmaps that have been used in the model during the current modeling session. Therefore, if you have placed ten background bitmaps in a viewport, all ten will be saved with theExportBitmapscommand; however, when the Rhino model is saved, only the last background bitmap will be saved in the .3dm file.
