The Cage command creates a box-shaped cage object to be used with the [CageEdit](cageedit.html) command to deform other objects.

Note
Cages with a small number of cage control points can modify more complex objects. This ensures that transitions are smoother than could be achieved using standard control point editing.After creating the cage object, use the [CageEdit](cageedit.html) command to capture objects with the cage. Use the cage's [control points](pointson.html) to deform the captive objects.Steps
