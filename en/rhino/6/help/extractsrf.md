Extract Surface
The ExtractSrf command separates or copies a polysurface face.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) the surfaces.Your browser does not support the video tag.Note
The surfaces are separated from the polysurfaces. The remainder of each polysurface will stay joined.The extracted surface is also removed from any groups to which the original surface may belong.To remove a surface from the selection, press [Ctrl](ctrl-key.html) while clicking.When you are extracting a surface from the polysurface theExtractSrfcommand can save you a lot of time (as opposed to [Explode](explode.html) ). This is because it lets you extract only the selected surfaces from the polysurface, and so there is not as much joining work to do afterward.Command-line options
Copy
The Copy option specifies whether or not the objects are copied. A plus sign![images/copyplus.png](images/copyplus.png)appears at the cursor when copy mode is on.
