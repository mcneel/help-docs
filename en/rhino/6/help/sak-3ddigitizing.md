# Use a digitizing arm
Digitizing arms are used to capture point data from a physical object in order to make a 3&#8209;D virtual model of the object.

Before you start using a digitizing arm, you must initialize and calibrate the digitizer.
You can calibrate digitizers so that a coordinate system in the real world corresponds to a coordinate system in Rhino. The calibration can change in the middle of the digitizing process to allow digitizing of the underside of an object, or an object that is larger than the reach of the digitizer.
You can set the scale factor for digitized points. By default, one inch in the real world is one Rhino unit.
Digitizers use a foot pedal to pick points.
The [DigClick](digitize.html#digclick) command allows you to pick points from within Rhino. You can set up a function key (such as F12) so that when you press the function key, it is as if you pressed the foot pedal.
