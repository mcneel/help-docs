The Hyperbola command draws a hyperbolic curve.
Steps
Follow the prompts for the selected option.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options
Default (Center)
The default option draws the hyperbola from the center, focus, and end.
Center steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) the center.Pick the focus.Pick the end.Your browser does not support the video tag.FromCoefficient
The FromCoefficient option uses the A and B coefficients of the hyperbola equation to define the curve.
FromCoefficient steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) the center.Pick a direction.Pick the end.FromCoefficient options
A/B
These are theAandBcoefficients of the equation that defines the hyperbola. The *A* coefficient represents the distance from the center point to the vertex of the hyperbola. IfCis the distance from the center point to the foci of the hyperbola, then *B* 2= *C* 2- *A* 2. The *B* coefficient can be considered the slope of the asymptotes.
{: #fromfoci}FromFoci
The FromFoci option draws the hyperbola starting from the focus points.
FromFoci steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) the first focus.Pick the second focus.Pick the end.Your browser does not support the video tag.FromVertex
The FromVertex option draws the hyperbola starting from the vertices.
FromVertex steps

MarkFoci
IfYes, a point object is placed at the focus locations.
