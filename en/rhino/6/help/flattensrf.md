The FlattenSrf command flattens surface edges onto the construction plane to create planar curves.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) a surface edge.Select another edge.Type a number for the sample point spacing.Note
The purpose of theFlattenSrfcommand is to draw a 2-D outline of a flattened view of a developable surface. This command cannot flatten all developable surfaces.The result of the command is a group of four curves that define the outline of the flattened surface, that have one corner at the world coordinate origin 0,0 and that is drawn in the world x,y plane.See also
