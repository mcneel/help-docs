The Circle command draws a circle from a center location and a radius.
Steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) the center location.Pick a radius location or [specify an option](specifycommandlineoption.html) .![images/circle-centerradius.png](images/circle-centerradius.png)Command-line options
{: #deformable}Deformable
Draws a [NURBS](http://www.rhino3d.com/nurbs) approximation of the curve will be created with the degree and number of points you specify.
![images/circle-deformable-001.png](images/circle-deformable-001.png)
Deformable (degree 3) (left); Not deformable (degree 2) (right).
Deformable options
Degree
Specifies the [degree](degree.html) of the arc.
When drawing a high-degree arc, the output curve will not be the degree you request unless there is at least one more [control point](controlpoint.html) than the degree.
PointCount
Specifies the number of [control points](controlpoint.html).
{: #2point}2Point
Draws the circle from the two ends of its diameter.
2Point steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) the start of the diameter. [Pick](pick-location.html) the end of the diameter.![images/circle-2pt.png](images/circle-2pt.png){: #3point}3Point
Draws a circle through three points on the circumference.
3Point steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) three points that define the circumference.![images/circle-3pt.png](images/circle-3pt.png)3Point option
Radius
Specifies the radius and orientation for the circle after two points have been picked.
Radius steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) a location or type a radius value.Pick a direction to orient the circle.{: #aroundcurve}AroundCurve
Draws a circle perpendicular to a curve.
AroundCurve steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) a curve and [pick](pick-location.html) the center of the circle on the curve and aRadiusorDiameter.![images/circle-aroundcurve.png](images/circle-aroundcurve.png){: #fitpoints}FitPoints![images/circle-fitpoints.png](images/circle-fitpoints.png)
Draws a circle by fitting to selected point objects, curve and surface [control points](controlpoint.html), and mesh vertices.
FitPoint steps
 [Select](select-objects.html)  [point objects](point.html) or [control points](controlpoint.html) .A minimum of three points or control points is required.![images/circle-fitpoints.png](images/circle-fitpoints.png){: #tangent}Tangent
Draws a circle tangent to curves.
Tangent steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) the first tangent location on the first curve.Pick the second tangent curve, or type a radius.Pick the third tangent curve, or press [Enter](enter-key.html) to draw the circle from the first and second tangent locations.![images/circle-tangent.png](images/circle-tangent.png)Tangent options
FromFirstPoint
Forces the circle or arc to go through the first picked point on the curve instead of allowing the point to slide along the curve.
Point
Allows a point that does not have to be a tangent point on a curve.
Radius
The circle is restricted to the specified radius. If a tangent point exists on the second curve that meets the radius requirement, the tangent constraint will appear at that point as you drag the circle.
{: #vertical}Vertical
Draws a circle perpendicular to the construction plane.
Vertical steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) the center and a radius or diameter.![images/circle-vertical.png](images/circle-vertical.png)Diameter/Radius options
Radius/Diameter
Toggles between accepting a radius value and a diameter value.
To switch between radius and diameter
 [Pick](pick-location.html) a location or type a value.Orientation
Specifies an orientation not on the construction plane.
To specify orientation
Pick a direction that will be perpendicular to the circle plane.![images/circleorientation-001.png](images/circleorientation-001.png)Perpendicular direction (1); Circle plane (2).
Circumference
Specifies the circle's circumference.
To specify circumference
Type the circumference value at the command line or pick a location to show the circumference length.Area
Specifies the circle's area.
To specify the area
Type the area value at the command line or pick a location to show the area value.See also
