Refit to Tolerance
The FitSrf command tries to reduce the number of surface [control points](controlpoint.html) while maintaining the surface's same general shape.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) surfaces.Type a newtolerancevalue or press [Enter](enter-key.html) to accept the default.Type0(zero) to use the current [absolute tolerance](units.html#absolutetolerance) .Note
Use the FitSrf command for replacing surfaces with too many [control points](controlpoint.html) .When the input to the FitSrf command is a wiggly surface with lots of control points, the FitSrf command tries to compute a surface that has the same general shape but fewer control points.Command-line options
DeleteInput
Yes

No
Retains the original geometry.
ReTrim
