Points qualify for display if the hair line is this close to the normal direction on either the curve or the surface. Default is 1 degree. No points disqualify at 180.
Hair scale
The hair is exaggerated by this factor from the actual distance to the curve or surface. Default is 10.
Display hair
Display the hair line for each qualifying point.
Make hair permanent

Median distance
The [median](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) distance between the selected points and the selected surface.
Standard deviation
