Rib
The Rib command extrudes a curve in two directions to a boundary surface.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) planar curves to rib.Select a boundary.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options
Offset
The offset direction relative to the input curve.
InCurvePlane
Use when the input curve describes the rib in plan view.
Your browser does not support the video tag.NormalToCurvePlane
Use when the rib curve describes the rib in elevation view.
Your browser does not support the video tag.Distance
Sets the offset distance.
Mode
Straight
Extrudes the curve straight to the boundary.
Tapered
Extrudes the curves to the boundary with a draft angle.
DraftAngle
Specify the *draft angle* for the taper.
The draft angle depends on the construction plane orientation. When the surface is vertical/perpendicular to the construction plane, the draft angle is zero. When the surface is parallel to the construction plane, the draft angle is 90 degrees.
