The ClearAllMeshes command deletes render and analysis meshes from all surfaces and polysurfaces.
Note
Render meshes are created automatically when you shade or render your model. They are not visible in wireframe view mode.TheClearAllMeshescommand turns off shaded working mode.If you change your [Render Mesh](mesh.html) settings and render or shade the model, render meshes are cleared and recreated automatically.If any viewports are in shaded or render preview mode, they are changed to wireframe mode. Switching back to shaded/render preview mode will create new meshes. To reduce the size of the model file, use the [SaveAs](save.html#saveas) command and checkSave small.To clear meshes from selected objects, use the [RefreshShade](refreshshade.html) command.See also
