Paste from Clipboard
Shortcut
 [Ctrl](ctrl-key.html) +V
The Paste command inserts objects from the Clipboard.
Note
If there are Rhino objects on the Clipboard, they are pasted into your model. [Object properties](properties.html) and location are restored with the object.When you paste objects into Rhino, they are placed on the same layer they came from in the original model. If the layer does not exist, it is created when the object is pasted.In the [command window](rhino-window.html#appwindow-commandhistory), on the right-click context menu, only text from the command prompt, text edit boxes, or other applications can be cut, copied, or pasted.See also
