The RebuildUV command reconstructs selected surfaces to a specified control point number in either the u or v&#160;directions independently.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) surfaces to rebuild.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options
Direction(Surfaces only)
Specify the u, v, or both [directions](curvesurfacedirection.html).
PointCount
The PointCount option specifies the number of [control points](controlpoint.html) in the result.
Type
Loose
The surface [control points](controlpoint.html) are created at the same locations as the control points of the original. This is a good option if the control points will be edited later.
Normal
The surface has an average amount of stretching between the curves. This is a good choice when the curves are proceeding in a relatively straight path or there is a lot of space between the curves.
Straight sections
Creates a ruled surface. The sections between the curves are straight.
Tight
The surface closely follows the original. This is a good choice when the input curves are going around a corner.
Uniform
Makes the object [knot vectors](knot.html) uniform.
DeleteInput
Yes
Deletes the original geometry.
No
Retains the original geometry.
CurrentLayer
The output will be on the current layer.
