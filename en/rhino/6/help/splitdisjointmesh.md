Note
Some STL/SLA printers have problems if meshes contain many long, thin facets. These can slow the printer's slicing process down, produce odd printed results, and run the printer out of memory.The [MeshRepair](meshrepair.html) command may be useful when tuning up meshes for STL/SLA printing.Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) a mesh.Mesh objects have the ability to appear to be separate objects while still belonging to the same mesh.This can happen due to mesh editing or by importing a mesh in this condition.See also
