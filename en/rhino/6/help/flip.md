The Flip command reverses the [normal](dir.html#normaldirection) direction of a curve or surface.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) objects.The command line reports the number of objects flipped.Note
Closed polysurfaces cannot have their normal direction facing toward the interior of the object.The curve and surface directions affect the results of many surface creation commands and Boolean operations. If Boolean operations give unexpected results, such as a union instead of a difference, try flipping the normal direction of one or both of the surfaces.See also
