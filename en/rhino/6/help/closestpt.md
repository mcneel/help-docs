To calculate the closest point to an object
 [Select](select-objects.html) a curve or point object.To select parts of objects, use [sub-object selection](selection-commands.html#sub-object-selection) .The closest point from that object to the originally selected object is calculated.Point objects are created at the closest points.This is especially useful for testing two curve objects.![images/closestpt-001.png](images/closestpt-001.png)CreateLine
