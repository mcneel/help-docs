The Save command saves the current model.
You can automatically save a backup file each time a model is saved.
See: [Options &gt; Files](files.html#save-bak).
Steps
In theFile namebox, type a name for the file.ClickSave.To save as an earlier version of Rhino
See [Rhino 3DM Earlier Versions](rhino-3dm-export-to-earlier-versions.html) .To save as a different file format
Type the file name with the desired extension.See: [Export](export.html).
{: #save-geometry-only}Options
Save small
Though clearing the render meshes makes the file smaller, it will shade and render more slowly the next time you open the file.
Save geometry only
Saves geometry objects only. No layers, materials, properties, notes, or units settings are saved.
This is similar to exporting the objects. A new file is made, but it does not become your active Rhino model.
Save Textures
Embeds external textures used by materials, environments and decals into the model.
Save plugin data
Saves data attached to objects or the document by plug-in applications.
In the emergency save (out of memory) situation, Rhino automatically attempts to save your current model under a different name and prevent you from saving over your last .3dm file. Search your hard disk for a file named RHINO_EMERGENCY_SAVE.3dm.
