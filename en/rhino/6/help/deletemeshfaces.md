Delete Mesh Faces
The DeleteMeshFaces command removes selected mesh faces from the parent mesh creating a hole to help repair and close mesh files for rapid prototype printing.
The DeleteMeshFaces command is most effective in a shaded display mode since you can pick within a shaded mesh facet to select it.

Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) mesh faces.Note
Some STL/SLA printers have problems if meshes contain many long, thin facets. These can slow the printer's slicing process down, produce odd printed results, and run the printer out of memory.The [MeshRepair](meshrepair.html) command may be useful when tuning up meshes for STL/SLA printing.See also
