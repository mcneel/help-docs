# Work with blocks, groups, and worksessions
Blocks, groups and worksessions are methods for organizing model elements.

## Work with blocks
Blocks are named groups of objects that act as a single object in your model. Blocks are useful for repeated objects such as symbols or components. Blocks save you time since you can reuse the components instead of re-drawing them each time. An advantage of using blocks for repeated content is that using blocks requires less memory. In addition, you can redefine a block and all of the instances placed in the model will update.
![images/block.png](images/block.png) [Block](block.html) 
Define a block object.
![images/blockedit.png](images/blockedit.png) [BlockEdit](blockedit.html) 
Allow selecting a block instance to change the block geometry and update the block definition.
![images/blockmanager.png](images/blockmanager.png) [BlockManager](blockmanager.html) 
Manage the block definitions.
![images/explodeblock.png](images/explodeblock.png) [ExplodeBlock](explode.html#explodeblock) 
Explode a block including any nested blocks into component objects.
![images/export.png](images/export.png) [Export](export.html) 
Save selected objects to a new file.
![images/exportwithorigin.png](images/exportwithorigin.png) [ExportWithOrigin](export.html#exportwithorigin) 
Save objects to a new file with a specified origin and construction plane.
![images/insert.png](images/insert.png) [Insert](insert.html) 
Insert block objects stored in the file or import a file as a block definition.
![images/modelbasepoint.png](images/modelbasepoint.png) [ModelBasepoint](modelbasepoint.html) 
Set a world origin that is used when inserting the model into another.
![images/replaceblock.png](images/replaceblock.png) [ReplaceBlock](replaceblock.html) 
Replace block instances with a different block definition.

## Work with groups
Grouping objects allows selecting multiple objects by picking one of the group components. Groups can be nested and named.
![images/group.png](images/group.png) [Group](group.html) 
Organize objects into a single component.
![images/addtogroup.png](images/addtogroup.png) [AddToGroup](group.html#addtogroup) 
Add an object to a selected group.
![images/removefromgroup.png](images/removefromgroup.png) [RemoveFromGroup](group.html#removefromgroup) 
Detach objects from their parent group.
![images/ungroup.png](images/ungroup.png) [Ungroup](group.html#ungroup) 
Remove the group status from objects.
![images/setgroupname.png](images/setgroupname.png) [SetGroupName](group.html#setgroupname) 
Name a group.

## Use worksessions
Worksessions allow multiple users to access the same models to use as reference geometry. A worksession is a list of models that can be viewed, snapped to, copied from and otherwise used as a reference for working on the active model.
![images/worksession.png](images/worksession.png) [Worksession](worksession.html) 
Manage a list of models that can be used as reference geometry.
