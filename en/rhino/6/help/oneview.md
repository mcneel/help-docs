The OneView sets the active construction plane according to the current view direction to accommodate single-window modeling.
The mode sets the nearest world construction plane to the current view; for example, Front, Right, Top, Bottom as you approach a view that looks at that plane. When there is no plane within the cut-off angle, the World Top becomes active.
This mode sets your viewport to a maximized perspective view.
To toggle snapping to plan views
Press&#160; [Ctrl](ctrl-key.html) &#160;+&#160; [Shift](shift-key.html) &#160;and move the right mouse button.Command-line options
Enabled
Turns on OneView mode, maximizes the perspective viewport, and sets it current.
Angle
The Angle setting determines how close to the nearest plane's normal your view direction needs to be before the construction plane is made active. The range is 1-44. Smaller numbers mean a longer wait as you rotate the view before a new construction plane is made active, and a shorter wait for switching away from the current one.
UpdateCPlane
Updates the construction plane to the viewport plane as you rotate the view.
ReturnCPlaneToTop
Sets the construction plane to Top as soon as you move out of a plane snap.
ViewLabel
Turns on a label in the view that indicates which construction plane is active.
