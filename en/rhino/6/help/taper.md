Transform
Taper
The Taper command deforms objects toward or away from a specified axis.
Steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) the start of an axis line to taper the objects around.See the [Line](line.html) command for option descriptions.Pick the end of the axis line.Pick the start distance.Pick the end distance.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options
Copy
![images/history-tag.png](images/history-tag.png) [&#160;History enabled](historyenabled.html) 
The Copy option specifies whether or not the objects are copied. A plus sign![images/copyplus.png](images/copyplus.png)appears at the cursor when copy mode is on.
The [RememberCopyOptions](remembercopyoptions.html) command determines whether the selected option is used as the default.
Rigid
The Rigid option specifies that individual objects will not be deformed as they are transformed.
The illustration shows the Rigid option with the Bend command.

Original objects (left), Rigid=No (center), Rigid=Yes (left).
Yes
Individual objects will not change, only their positions will change.
No
Individual objects are transformed as well as their positions.

Your browser does not support the video tag.Rigid=No.
Flat
Creates a one-directional, one-dimensional taper.
Your browser does not support the video tag.Infinite
The Infinite option determines the length of the taper.
Yes
The deformation happens throughout the object, even if the axis is shorter.
No
The deformation takes place only the length of the axis. The length of the axis is important. If the axis is shorter than the object, the taper applies only to that part of the object.
Your browser does not support the video tag.PreserveStructure
Specifies whether the control-point structure of a curve or surface will be maintained after the deformation.
The PreserveStructure option does not apply to polysurfaces, and will not be displayed if polysurfaces are selected for editing.
Yes
The [control point](controlpoint.html) structure of the surface is maintained. Deformation may be less accurate if there are too few control points in on the object.
No
The objects are [refit](fitcrv.html) as needed with more [control points](controlpoint.html) to allow accurate deformation.
