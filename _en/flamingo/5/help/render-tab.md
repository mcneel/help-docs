The render tab controls the main properties of the final rendering.  Use this tab to control quality and length of time a rendering can take.  Resolution of the final image is one of the biggest influences on overall rendering times.

Note: A good practice is to leave the rendering resolution low during draft renderings. Use high resolution renderings for final renderings only.
