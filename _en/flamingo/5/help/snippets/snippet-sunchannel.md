#### Sun channel
{: sun-channel}
Specify the [lighting channel](lights-tab.html#channel) the Sun will render to. It is very useful to place the Sun on a specific channel when trying to balance the sun strength with other light sources. The default channel is 0. Rendering to a channel will allow the strength of the sunlight to be quickly adjusted after a rendering without the need to re-render.
