### Assign material by
Using a plug-in library, rendering properties can be assigned to layers, or to objects that will be used with the basic Rhino renderer.

#### Layer
The object inherits the render material assigned to the layer. To change the material assignment of the layer, use the [ **Layers** ](layer.html) dialog box.
 **Note** : Deleting a material from the ** [Material Editor](materialeditor.html) **, returns all objects that had the deleted material assigned to assignment by layer.

#### Parent
The object inherits the render material from its parent object.

#### Object
Render materials are assigned to individual objects and are used by Rhino's built-in renderer.
See ** [MaterialEditor](materialeditor.html) **.
