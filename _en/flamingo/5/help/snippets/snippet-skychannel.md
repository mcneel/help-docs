#### Sky channel
{: #sky-channel}
Specify the [lighting channel](lights-tab.html#channel) the Sky will render to. It is very useful to place the Sky on a specific channel when trying to balance the sky strength with other light sources. The default channel is 0. Rendering to a channel will allow the strength of the skylight to be quickly adjusted after a rendering without the need to rerender.
