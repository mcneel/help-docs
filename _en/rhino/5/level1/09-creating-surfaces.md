# Creating surfaces
A Rhino surface is similar to a piece of stretchy fabric. It can take on many different shapes.
Surfaces are bounded by curves called edges. To visualize the surface shape Rhino displays a grid of isoparametric curves (isocurves) on the surface.
Surfaces have an area, their shape can be changed by moving control points, and they can be meshed.

This command is very useful for putting a smooth end cap on an irregularly shaped surface.![images/extrudecrv.png](images/extrudecrv.png)ExtrudeCrvExtrudes a curve perpendicular to the construction plane with option to taper the surface with a draft angle.![images/extrudecrvalongcrv.png](images/extrudecrvalongcrv.png)ExtrudeCrvAlongCurveExtrudes a curve following along a second curve.![images/extrudecrvtopoint.png](images/extrudecrvtopoint.png)ExtrudeCrvToPointExtrudes a curve to a point.![images/plane.png](images/plane.png)PlaneCreates a rectangular planar surface parallel to the construction plane from two diagonal points.![images/plane3pt.png](images/plane3pt.png)Plane 3PointCreates a rectangular planar surface from 3 points.![images/planevertical.png](images/planevertical.png)Plane VerticalCreates a rectangular planar surface from 3 points that is vertical to the construction plane.
