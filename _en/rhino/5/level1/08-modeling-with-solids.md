# Modeling with Solids
Several commands that enable you create and edit solid objects.
Solids in Rhino are closed surfaces or polysurfaces that enclose a volume. Some of the solid primitives are closed single-surfaces carefully edge-matched, others are polysurfaces.
Rhinoâ€™s polysurface objects are deformable by using the UDT (Uniform Deformation Technology) tools. You can also extract surfaces and deform the surfaces with control point editing like the last exercise.
In this part of the class we will focus on making some solids, separating the parts, making changes and then joining the parts back together to make a solid.
