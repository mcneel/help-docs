Merge Edge
The MergeEdge command combines adjacent edges of the same simple surface into one edge.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) an edge on a surface or a polysurface.If possible, the edge will merge to an adjacent edge of the same simple surface into one edge. Otherwise "Edge is already merged" appears at the command line, and the prompt repeats.
Select an adjacent edge.Note
The edges must belong to the same surface, must share an endpoint, and must meet smoothly at the shared endpoint.Use the [ShowEdges](showedges.html) command to display edges and their ends.Use the [MergeAllEdges](mergealledges.html) command when complex polysurfaces have been unjoined, and split edges are interfering with the [Join](join.html) command.See also
