The Crv2View command creates a curve from selected curves that are planar in different views.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) the first curve.Select the second curve.A third curve is created from two curves that are planar in different construction planes. The new curve looks the same as each of the original curves when viewed in each plane.Your browser does not support the video tag.Note
Use Crv2View to create a curve when you know its profile in two directions. The example demonstrates creating a curve that follows the edge of a boat hull from 2-D curves in the top and front views.The [AlignProfiles](alignprofiles.html) command is useful for lining up curves in two views prior to creating a curve from two views.Command-line option
Direction
Two points establish the direction angle.
Direction steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) a base point.Pick a second point that establishes the direction angle.See also
