# Extract mesh faces
The Extract Mesh Faces commands help to edit existing meshes by removing unwanted or unnecessary faces from the mesh. Mesh faces can be extracted using:
 [Selecting individual faces](#extractmeshfaces). [A specified maximum or minimum area](#extractmeshfacesbyarea). [A specified aspect ratio](#extractmeshfacesbyaspectratio). [By a view-based draft angle](#extractmeshfacesbydraftangle). [Duplicate faces](#extractduplicatemeshfaces). [A specified edge length](#extractmeshfacesbyedgelength). [Faces that are connected to a selected face](#extractconnectedmeshfaces) .Note
Some STL/SLA printers have problems if meshes contain many long, thin facets. These can slow the printer's slicing process down, produce odd printed results, and run the printer out of memory.The [MeshRepair](meshrepair.html) command may be useful when tuning up meshes for STL/SLA printing.

Faces
The ExtractMeshFaces command separates selected mesh faces from the parent mesh object.
This command works best in shaded mode, because you can pick the shaded mesh faces as well as the face edges.

Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) mesh faces.Command-line option
MakeCopy
Yes
Makes a copy of the selected mesh faces rather than extracting them from the parent mesh object.
No
Extracts the mesh faces leaving a hole in the parent mesh object.

 **Select range from face** 
Select an example mesh face to set the size range. A range of Â±10% of the area of the selected face is used.

By Aspect Ratio
The ExtractMeshFacesByAspectRatio command separates mesh faces from the parent mesh object that are greater than the specified aspect ratio limit.
ExtractMeshFacesByAspectRatio finds mesh faces that are very long compared to their width. A ratio of 25:1 or above is considered long.
In the image, the extracted red faces have an aspect ratio of 9:1 or more.

Set the target aspect ratio.
Increment
Sets the amount the value is changed with each arrow click.
 **Select aspect ratio from face** 
Select a mesh face to specify theAspect Ratiovalue.

By Draft Angle
The ExtractMeshFacesByDraftAngle command separates mesh faces from the parent mesh object based on the angle of the faces to the view.
ExtractMeshFacesByDraftAngle can split a mesh object for molds or to look for undercut areas. In the example, the mesh faces were selected in the top view.

Sets the starting angle from the direction of the viewport camera.
End angle from camera direction
Sets the ending angle from the direction of the viewport camera.

By Edge Length
The ExtractMeshFacesByEdgeLength command separates selects mesh faces from the parent mesh object that have an edge length greater or less than a specified value.
ExtractMeshFacesByEdgeLength removes small or large mesh faces that do not belong in the mesh object.
In the example image, the extracted red faces have an edge length shorter than 0.1.

Steps

Edge length
Sets the mesh edge length to compare.
 **Select edge** 
Pick a mesh edge to specify the edge length you want.
Increment
Sets the amount the value is changed with each arrow click.
Select edges:
Shorter than edge length
Selects mesh faces with an edge length shorter than theEdge lengthsetting.
Longer than edge length
Selects mesh faces with an edge length longer than theEdge lengthsetting.

Connected
The ExtractConnectedMeshFaces command separates mesh faces from the parent mesh object that are connected to a selected face.
The ExtractConnectedMeshFaces command extracts a set of mesh faces from a joined mesh object based on a specified break angle. This can be used to extract a series of mesh faces that make up a planar surface in a mesh object or to extract set of faces that make up a coherent feature in the mesh.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) mesh faces, and press [Enter](enter-key.html) .Adjust options to get the selection you want.Your browser does not support the video tag.Extract connected mesh faces options
Extract faces connected with angle
Sets the angle between mesh faces for selection.
Less than / Greater than ___ degrees
Note
A setting of 0 will give you all the mesh faces that are connected and planar with the face you select.Sometimes planar meshes have a little noise in them, so a angle of 1 can help select planar faces.Increment
Sets the amount the value is changed with each arrow click.
 **Select faces to measure angle** 
Select two mesh faces to specify the angle you want.
Border only
Makes polylines out of the edges of the selected mesh faces instead of extracting them from the parent mesh object.
Extract a copy
Makes a copy of the selected mesh faces rather than extracting them from the parent mesh object.
 **Edit Selection** 
Click to select a different mesh face.
