Align
The Align command lines up the bounding boxes of objects.{: #kanchor60}
Bounding boxes can line up at their bottom, horizontal center, left, right, top, or vertical center.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) the objects to align, and press [Enter](enter-key.html). [Specify](specifycommandlineoption.html) an alignment option.At the prompt for an alignment point, [pick a location](pick-location.html), or press [Enter](enter-key.html) to align based on the overall bounding box of all selected objects.Alignment type options

The Distribute command spreads objects out evenly between the end objects.
![images/distribute-001.png](images/distribute-001.png)
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) the objects to distribute, and press [Enter](enter-key.html) .Groups are considered a single object. [Specify](specifycommandlineoption.html) a direction.The objects are distributed according to even spacing between bounding box centers or according to gaps between the bounding box edges (all aligned to the direction axis).Command-line options
Direction
Defines the direction of the distribution. Point picking is constrained to the construction plane.
XAxis
Distributes objects based on x-axis of the active construction plane.
YAxis
Distributes objects based on x-axis of the active construction plane.
Mode
Specifies how the objects are distributed.
Gap
Provides even spacing between the edges of object bounding boxes.
Center
Provides even spacing between the center of object bounding boxes.
Spacing
Automatic
Automatic spacing calculates the gap/center spacing based on bounding box distances of the first and last objects, spatially sorted.
Distance
Specifies the desired spacing.
