The WalkAbout command toggles the viewport navigation between WalkAbout mode and normal navigation mode.
WalkAbout mode changes the way the mouse actions, the arrow keys and the [Shift](shift-key.html) key and [Ctrl](ctrl-key.html) mouse combinations work.
The viewport title changes to "WalkAbout" to indicate WalkAbout mode.
Use the [Camera](camera.html) command,Showoption to see the camera movement in the other viewports.

 [Right mouse button](mouse-buttons.html) drag
Control yaw and pitch of the camera (turning your head and looking up or down).
 [Mouse wheel](mouse-buttons.html) 
Walk/dolly the camera forward and backward.

 [Ctrl](ctrl-key.html) + [Shift](shift-key.html) + [Right mouse button](mouse-buttons.html) drag
Rotate the camera around the target and auto-target an object.
Auto-targeting means that the camera will rotate around a shaded object that the WalkAbout view’s crosshairs touch. Auto-targeting will also work in Wireframe viewports if the objects have been previously shaded.
You can use the right-mouse-button drag to rotate the target around the camera, aim at an object, and then press Shift + Ctrl and click and drag the right-mouse-button to rotate the camera around the object.
If you are dexterous, you can press the right-mouse-button and then the left-mouse button and hold them down at the same time to target an object and rotate the camera.
 [Shift](shift-key.html) + [Right mouse button](mouse-buttons.html) drag
