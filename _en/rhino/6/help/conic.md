Steps
 [Pick](pick-location.html) thestart.Pick theend.Pick theapex.This location partially defines the plane for the conic.Pick a location for the conic to pass through to define its curvature.Or, type a the *rho* value (a number greater than 0 and less than 1), and press [Enter](enter-key.html) .Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options
Apex
Pick theapex("top" [control point](controlpoint.html) ).

Types of conics
Parabola
The intersection of a right circular cone and a plane that passes through the side of the cone and the base of the cone.
Rho value of 0.5.

Hyperbola
The intersection of a right circular cone and a plane perpendicular to the cone's base.
Rho values greater than 0.5 and less than 1.
