Refresh Shade
The RefreshShade command clears and regenerates the render mesh from selected objects so the shading refreshes.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) objects to remesh.Render and analysis meshes are cleared and regenerated from the selected objects.This mode is turned off in all viewports with the [ClearAllMeshes](clearallmeshes.html) command.Note
To avoid having to recreate the render meshes in your next session, do not clear meshes.Render meshes are cleared and recreated automatically if you change your [Render Mesh Properties](mesh.html) and render or shade the model.To reduce the size of the model file, use the [SaveAs](save.html#saveas) command and check Save small.See also
