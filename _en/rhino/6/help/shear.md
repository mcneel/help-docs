Shear
The Shear command skews objects parallel to one axis at a specified angle.
A sheared rectangle, for example, is transformed into a parallelogram. The sides of the parallelogram will progressively lengthen as deformation proceeds but the top and bottom lines maintain their original length.

The Copy option specifies whether or not the objects are copied. A plus sign![images/copyplus.png](images/copyplus.png)appears at the cursor when copy mode is on.
The [RememberCopyOptions](remembercopyoptions.html) command determines whether the selected option is used as the default.
Rigid
The Rigid option specifies that individual objects will not be deformed as they are transformed.
The illustration shows the Rigid option with the Bend command.
