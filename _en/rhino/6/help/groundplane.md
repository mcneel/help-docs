Ground Plane
The GroundPlane command opens the Ground Plane panel.
The ground plane provides an infinite horizontal platform for the image that stretches to the horizon in all directions positioned at a defined elevation. A ground plane renders much faster than using a surface as a background. Any material can be assigned to the ground plane.
The ground plane does not display in [Technical](view-displaymode-options.html#technical) or [Wireframe](view-displaymode-options.html#wireframe) display modes.

Sets the ground plane's height above the xy&#160;plane.
Automatic
Places the ground plane just below the lowest element in the model. As new objects are added to the scene, the ground plane can move.
Material
Assigns a material to the ground plane.
Shadow only
Makes the ground plane transparent, but allows shadows to still be cast on it.
For information on setting a material, see [Material Editor](materialeditor.html).
