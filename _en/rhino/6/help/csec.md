The CSec command creates cross-section curves through profile curves.
Note
The cross-section lines must cross all of the profile curves.For best results, space the cross section curves relatively evenly.Steps
Using any curve creation command, draw profile curves that roughly define the shape of your object. [Select](select-objects.html) the profile curves. [Pick](pick-location.html) the start of a line that will define the cross-section plane that is perpendicular to the current construction plane.Turning on [Ortho](ortho.html) or [Grid Snap](snap.html) may help you control the section planes.Pick the end of the cross-section plane.In the plane defined at the cross-section line, a curve will be created that passes through the profile curves, and press [Enter](enter-key.html) .Once you have made the cross-section curves, you can use the [Loft](loft.html) or other command to create a surface through them.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line option
Closed
Determines whether closed curves or curves that start at the first profile line and end at the last profile line are created.
