Move Face
The MoveFace command moves a polysurface face.
The surrounding joined surfaces are adjusted to accommodate the new face orientation.
Faces on relatively simple polysurfaces such as boxy planar shapes can be moved to adjust things like wall locations in a building or planes in a mechanical part.
