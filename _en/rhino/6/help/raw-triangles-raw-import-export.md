# Raw Triangles (.raw) Import/Export
This file format contains polygon mesh objects that consist of triangular polygon faces only.
Raw import supports ASCII format only.

## Import
To open, import, insert, and attach a file as a worksession
From theFilemenu, click [Open](open.html) or [Import](import.html) .In theOpendialog box, select the supported file type.If the import can be configured, click **Options** to specify import settings.ClickOpen, or press [Enter](enter-key.html) .When Rhino opens a non-3dm model, the title bar reflects the name of the model that was opened. When the model is saved for the first time, this model name is entered as the file name.Raw Triangle Import Options
Current Rhino units
Displays the units in the current file. This applies only to the [Import](import.html) and [Insert](insert.html) commands. The [Open](open.html) command displays Rhino units asNone.
If the Rhino file and the file being imported have different units, the imported model geometry will be scaled accordingly.
Always use these settings. Do not show this dialog again.
Saves the current settings and turns off the dialog display.
To turn the message back on
Click **Options** in the appropriate [Save](save.html), [Export](export.html), [Open](open.html), [Import](import.html), or [Insert](insert.html) dialog box.
## Export
To save as or export a Rhino model
From theFilemenu, click [Export Selected](export.html) or [Save As](save.html#saveas) .In the dialog box, theFiles of typelist displays the currently supported file types for export.In theFiles of typebox, select the supported file type.In theFile namebox, select or type a file name.Specify what is to be saved.Save small
Though clearing the render meshes makes the file smaller, it will shade and render more slowly the next time you open the file.
Save geometry only
Saves geometry objects only. No layers, materials, properties, notes, or units settings are saved.
This is similar to exporting the objects. A new file is made, but it does not become your active Rhino model.
Save Textures
Embeds external textures used by materials, environments and decals into the model.
Save plugin data
Saves data attached to objects or the document by plug-in applications.
If the export can be configured, click **Options** to specify export settings.If the file type creates only mesh objects, in the [Polygon Mesh Objects](polygon-mesh-simple-options.html) dialog box, specify the mesh settings.To break a polygon mesh into triangles and quadrangles, use [.dxf](autocad-dwg-dxf-import-export.html) instead.&#160;
