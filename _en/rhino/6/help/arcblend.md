The ArcBlend command creates a blend curve consisting of two arcs between two curves with adjustable endpoints and bulge.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) the first curve near the end you want to blend.Select the second curve near the end you want to blend.Select the arc blend points to adjust.Drag the point to set the arc control polygon length ratio. Type zero or snap to ends to minimize radius difference.Type zero to automatically pick a ratio that makes the arc radii the same when possible and as close to being the same as possible otherwise.Select another arc blend point to adjust, or press [Enter](enter-key.html) to end the command.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options
AlternateSolution
Offers the longer solution when more than one arc fills the requirements.
RadiusDifference
Makes it possible to draw an S-shaped blend where the difference of the two radii is specified.
If the difference is positive the first radius will be bigger than second, and if negative the first radius will be smaller.
Trim
Trims the input curves to the resulting curve.
Join
Joins the resulting curves.
