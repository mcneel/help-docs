# Boolean objects
Use Boolean operations to shortcut trimming and joining operations.

## Boolean solids
The Boolean commands work best on closed surfaces and polysurfaces that intersect each other completely.
![images/boolean2objects.png](images/boolean2objects.png) [Boolean2Objects](boolean2objects.html) 
Cycle through possible Boolean operations between two objects.
![images/booleandifference.png](images/booleandifference.png) [BooleanDifference](booleandifference.html) 
Subtract the volume of one set of objects from another.
![images/booleanintersection.png](images/booleanintersection.png) [BooleanIntersection](booleanintersection.html) 
Create a new solid from solids' intersected volumes.
![images/booleansplit.png](images/booleansplit.png) [BooleanSplit](booleansplit.html) 
Split and close solids at intersections.
![images/booleanunion.png](images/booleanunion.png) [BooleanUnion](booleanunion.html) 
Combine the volumes of one or more objects.
![images/-no-toolbar-button.png](images/-no-toolbar-button.png) [CreateRegions](createregions.html) 
Replace a non-manifold polysurface with all solid manifold regions defined by the surfaces of the input.

## Boolean curves
Curve Boolean operations quickly trim, split, and join overlapping curves.
![images/curveboolean.png](images/curveboolean.png) [CurveBoolean](curveboolean.html) 
Trim, split, and join curves based on their overlapping regions.

## Boolean meshes
The mesh Boolean commands work best on closed mesh objects.
![images/meshbooleandifference.png](images/meshbooleandifference.png) [MeshBooleanDifference](meshbooleandifference.html) 
Subtract the volume of one set of objects from another resulting in a mesh.
![images/meshbooleanintersection.png](images/meshbooleanintersection.png) [MeshBooleanIntersection](meshbooleanintersection.html) 
Create a new mesh from the intersected volumes of objects.
![images/meshbooleansplit.png](images/meshbooleansplit.png) [MeshBooleanSplit](meshbooleansplit.html) 
Split and close objects at intersections.
![images/meshbooleanunion.png](images/meshbooleanunion.png) [MeshBooleanUnion](meshbooleanunion.html) 
Combine the volumes of objects into a single mesh.
