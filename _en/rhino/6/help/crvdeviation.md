Deviation
The CrvDeviation command reports the maximum and minimum distances between two curves.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) two curves.The command may find one or more intervals of overlap between the two curves, or it may report that the curves do not overlap.
For each overlap interval, three pairs of indicator marks with indicator lines between them will appear, joining the ends of the overlap interval to the points of greatest deviation within the interval.
Minimum deviation = Green Marks
Maximum deviation = Red Marks
For each overlap interval, the three deviation distances are reported at the command line, along with the world coordinates of the interval ends on each curve.
Use the [Command History](rhino-window.html#appwindow-commandhistory) window or press **F2** to view the data in a separate window.
Press [Enter](enter-key.html) to turn off the deviation display.See also
