The Rhino Legend
![images/rhinorenderedplainblack.png](images/rhinorenderedplainblack.png)
Early in the development process, "Rhino" was used as a prototype name. Rhinoceros knickknacks and pictures started accumulating in the office. By the time the product was in beta testing, the name stuck.
Seattle artist [Frank Woll](http://www.frankwoll.com/) designed the Rhinoceros logo. Frank began using Rhino during its first beta phase for his painting, sculpture, and jewelry design. Frank's work follows in the tradition of Northwest Coastal Native American form. Mikko Oksanen's model of the logo is included with Rhino as a sample.
