Draw order defines how coincidental or overlapping objects are displayed.
Currently it supports hatches, curves, points, annotation (all forms of text other than dots), and details.
In the illustrations, the objects are displayed in [Ghosted Viewport](view-displaymode-options.html#ghosted) mode. The gray surface is on the same plane as the red hatch and the blue hatch. The surface appears to be blended with the hatches.

Default draw order.
Note
Objects within blocks maintain and display the draw order set before the block was created. When two blocks overlap, the one moved to display above the other will mask the block below.Selected objects draw on top.New objects are not given a draw order by default.Surfaces and meshes are not supported for draw order calculations; however, supported objects can be brought forward to display in front of a [Picture](picture.html) object.A set of objects in both the layout space and in the model viewport cannot be controlled with draw order. Draw order is restricted to modifying the display of objects in the same space.
