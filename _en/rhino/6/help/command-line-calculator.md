Any time you are entering a number, length, point coordinate, or angle, you can use a math formula.
In addition to addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, you can also use parenthesis and math functions.
Examples:If you need the number pi (3.14159...), typepi.When prompted for a point, to get a point 10 units from the origin rotated counter-clockwise 30 degrees, type:10*sin(30degrees),10*cos(30degrees)When prompted for any coordinate or length, append any metric or US customary length unit or abbreviation that makes sense any of the languages Rhino supports. For example:10m10meter10meters10metros10metre10metresWhen prompted for any angle value, append any angle unit name makes sense any of the languages Rhino supports.
