How to chain select
Select the first segment.ChainEdges options
AutoChain
Selecting a curve or surface edge automatically selects all curve segments connected with the level of [continuity](continuity-descriptions.html) set by theChainContinuityoption.
ChainContinuity
Controls the level of [continuity](continuity-descriptions.html) required between segments to be selected with theAutoChainoption.
Direction
Forward
Selects curves in the positive curve [direction](dir.html#normaldirection).
Backward
Selects curves in the negative curve [direction](dir.html#normaldirection).
Both
Selects curves in both the positive and negative curve [direction](dir.html#normaldirection).
GapTolerance
If the gap between two edges/curves is less than this value, the chain selection will ignore the gap and will select the next segment.
