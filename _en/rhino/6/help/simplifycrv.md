Simplify Lines and Arcs
The SimplifyCrv command replaces each curve segment that has the geometry of a line or an arc with a true line or arc.
Note
SimplifyCrv also combines consecutive co-linear and co-circular segments. [NURBS](http://www.rhino3d.com/nurbs) curves are broken apart at [knot](knot.html) .Tangent joins are tuned up to meet tangent with machine precision.Steps
