The Project command creates curves or points on a surface that are the intersections of the surface and curves or points projected toward the construction plane.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) curves and points to project.Select surfaces and polysurfaces.Infinite Plane: TypeIPfor [InfinitePlane](infiniteplane.html) options.
Your browser does not support the video tag.Note
You can select all the projection objects and target surfaces before starting the command.The curves are projected vertical to the construction plane that is active when the surface selection is completed.If the projection misses the selected surfaces and polysurfaces, a curve will not be created. Make sure the correct construction plane is active when you select the surfaces.The [Pull](pull.html) command will suck the curve back toward the surface by closest points. The Project command will not work in situations where you want to pull a curve onto a cylinder when the curve goes most of the way around the cylinder. Use the [Pull](pull.html) command in this case.TheProjectcommand creates complex curves that can be simplified with the [Rebuild](rebuild.html) command. You will need to be careful with the [Rebuild](rebuild.html) command and use enough points to keep the curve trimmable.TheProjectcommand can be faster than [Extrude](extrudecrv.html) followed by [Trim](trim.html) or [Split](split.html) .Smooth projection curves create smooth trim curves. Basic shapes like ellipses, circles, lines, and free-form curves work well for projection curves.Options
