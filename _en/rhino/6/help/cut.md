 [Ctrl](ctrl-key.html) +X
The Cut command deletes objects from the model and places them in the Clipboard.
Note
All selected objects are removed from your model and placed on the Clipboard. [Object properties](properties.html) and location are stored with the object.When you [Paste](paste.html) objects into Rhino, they are placed on the same layer they came from in the original model. If the layer does not exist, it is created when the object is pasted.In the [command window](rhino-window.html#appwindow-commandhistory), on the right-click context menu, only text from the command prompt, text edit boxes, or other applications can be cut, copied, or pasted.See also
