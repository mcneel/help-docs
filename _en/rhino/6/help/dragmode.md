{: #controlpolygon}ControlPolygon
Allows dragging a curve/surface control point along the control polygons that connect to it.
Note
When dragging multiple control points press [Shift](shift-key.html) key to make all points move the same absolute amount instead of moving proportionally based on the length of each control polygon chord.To track on extensions of the control polygon, track to the control polygon in the opposite direction a short distance, press theTabkey to lock the direction, and then drag out along the extension.{: #cplane}CPlane
Sets object dragging parallel to the construction plane.
{: #uvn}UVN
Sets surface control point dragging to conform to the surface u, v, and normal [directions](curvesurfacedirection.html).
{: #view}View
Sets object dragging parallel to the view plane.
{: #world}World
Sets object dragging parallel to the world xy plane.
{: #next}Next
Sets object dragging to the next mode in the list.

The DragStrength command sets the amount of drag strength for [Gumball](gumball.html) and for dragging objects, including control points.
The command when the control is open the drag strength can be set numerically, or using the spinners or the slider. The spinners halve or double the drag strength per click. When the control is closed, drag strength is reset to 100%. However, the control remembers its setting within an editing session and will reset the drag strength when the control is reopened.
