ApplyCurves
The ApplyCrv command wraps a curve onto a surface.
Use the [CreateUVCrv](createuvcrv.html) command to generate planar versions of the [u and v](curvesurfacedirection.html) curves of a surface so you can use them as a guide to orient your text. You must then also map the u and v curves along with the curves you are applying so they will act as a placeholder.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) planar curves on world xy plane to apply to a surface.Select a surface to apply the planar curves to.Corresponding 3-D curves are created and mapped onto the surface.Your browser does not support the video tag.See also
