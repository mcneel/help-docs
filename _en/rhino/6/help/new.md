The New command creates a new Rhino model based on a template.
Steps
Select a template on which to base your model file.Options
Use this file when Rhino starts
Uses the selected template as a default next time you create a new model.
 **No template** 
Starts Rhino using the internal defaults.

## Templates
{: #templates}
A template is a 3DM file that includes all the information that is stored in a Rhino 3DM file: geometry, grid settings, viewport layout, layers, units, and tolerances.
For example, if you want Rhino to use inches as default units, use theNewcommand to open the template you want to change, change the [units](units.html) to inches and use the [SaveAsTemplate](save.html#saveastemplate) command to overwrite the changes to the template.
If you do not have a default template file specified in the current user section of the registry, you will have to choose a start-up template.
If the "Ask every time Rhino starts" check box is not selected, the default template file will be set to the one selected file and will be used when Rhino starts from then on.
Templates are stored in the [Rhino support folder](supportfilelocation.html).
