Mapping channels{: #kanchor3100}
A mapping channel holds a set of texture-mapping parameters. Each mapping channel is identified by a number. An object can have any number of channels and therefore can hold any number of texture mapping types.Textures in materials can be assigned a channel number. When the textures are applied to an object, the texture is applied using the matching channel number on the object. Texture channels default to channel 1.If an object has no applied texture mapping, uv&#160;surface mapping is used to map the texture. [Open topic with navigation](mapping-channels.html)
