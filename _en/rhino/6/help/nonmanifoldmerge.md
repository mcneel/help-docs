The NonmanifoldMerge command creates a [non-manifold polysurface](non-manifold-edges.html) from intersecting surfaces and polysurfaces.
Surfaces are split and edges joined as needed. This generally only useful for export to analysis programs and can cause normal Rhino operations on these objects to fail.
Command-line option
DeleteInput
Yes
Deletes the original geometry.
