The QuadrangulateMesh command merges mesh triangles into quadrangles.
Diagonals that are [unwelded](weld.html) (have unique vertexes at the corners) will not be considered as candidates for merging triangles into quadrangles.

Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) mesh objects.Options
Planarity
The angle between the face normals of the triangles.
Rectangularity
Specify a number greater than or equal to 1. If the adjacent triangles pass the planarity test then they will be merged into a quadrangle if the largest ratio of the lengths of the diagonal is less than or equal to the number you typed, then the triangles are converted to quadrangle.
