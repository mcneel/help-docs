Scale 3-D
The Scale command changes the size of selected objects uniformly in the x, y, and z&#160;directions.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) objects. [Pick](pick-location.html) a base point, or press [Enter](enter-key.html) to use the center of the bounding box of all selected objects as the base point.Type the scale factor, or pick two reference points.Your browser does not support the video tag.To scale an object from an arbitrary size to a specific one
Use the origin point and the first reference point to establish the original size of the object.Type the new size for the second reference point.When scaling by dragging, the scale factor becomes the default the next time you use that scale command.Command-line options
Copy

The Copy option specifies whether or not the objects are copied. A plus sign![images/copyplus.png](images/copyplus.png)appears at the cursor when copy mode is on.
The [RememberCopyOptions](remembercopyoptions.html) command determines whether the selected option is used as the default.
Rigid
The Rigid option specifies that individual objects will not be deformed as they are transformed.
The illustration shows the Rigid option with the Bend command.
![images/rigid-bend.png](images/rigid-bend.png)
Original objects (left), Rigid=No (center), Rigid=Yes (left).
Yes
Individual objects will not change, only their positions will change.
No
Individual objects are transformed as well as their positions.

Scale 1-D
The Scale1D command changes the size of selected objects in one direction.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) objects. [Pick](pick-location.html) a base point, or press [Enter](enter-key.html) to use the center of the bounding box of all selected objects as the base point.Type the scale factor and a direction, or pick two reference points.The objects expand or contract in the single direction specified, without expanding the objects in the other directions.When scaling by dragging, the scale factor becomes the default next time the Scale1D command is used.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options

Scale 2-D
The Scale2D command changes the size of selected objects uniformly in two directions.
Steps

Non-Uniform Scale
The ScaleNU command changes the size of selected objects in three directions using different lengths for each direction.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) objects. [Pick](pick-location.html) an origin.Type the x scale factor, or pick two reference points.(Press [Enter](enter-key.html) for a scale of 1.0.)Type the y scale factor, or pick two reference points.(Press [Enter](enter-key.html) for a scale of 1.0.)Type the z scale factor, or pick two reference points.(Press [Enter](enter-key.html) for a scale of 1.0.)The objects expand or contract in the three directions with the scale factor values specified.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options
