The MeshPatch command creates a polygon mesh from curves and points.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) curves and points.Select closed interior curves to be used to create holes in the mesh, or press [Enter](enter-key.html) to create a mesh with no holes.Closed curves used as the inner boundary are treated as holes.Your browser does not support the video tag.Command-line options
AngleTolerance
Used to make polyline approximations of curves. If only polylines are selected, this setting has no effect on the final output.
StartingSurface
Use a reference surface that is similar in shape to the mesh you are trying to create. The surface will influence the mesh shape.
