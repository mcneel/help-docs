The CopyToClipboard command copies selected objects to the Clipboard.
Note
The object's [Properties](properties.html) and location are stored with the object.If the objects are [grouped](group.html), a new group is created from the copied objects. The objects are not added to the group from which they were copied.When you [Paste](paste.html) objects into Rhino, they are placed on the same layer they originally had. If the layer does not exist, it is created when the object is pasted.Right-click the [Paste](paste.html) toolbar button to paste objects on the current layer.In addition to geometry, the viewport image and command history text is copied.When you paste into a program that accepts images such as Paint Shop Pro or Microsoft Word, the viewport image is pasted.In the [command window](rhino-window.html#appwindow-commandhistory), on the right-click context menu, only text from the command prompt, text edit boxes, or other applications can be cut, copied, or pasted.Rhino 6 can accept paste from Rhino 4, 5, or 6.Rhino 6 copies into Rhino 5 or 6.See also
