The Safe Frame shows the area of the viewport that will be rendered in the active viewport. If parts of the rendered view are off-screen, the safe frame will indicate this by displaying arrows either at the top and bottom or left and right. In addition, several safe-frame areas can be added to show the extent of commonly used zones in the image. The sizes of these zones can be customized.
Safe frame is useful when rendering resolution is set differently form the active viewport.
