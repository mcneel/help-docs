The ExtrudeCrvAlongCrv command creates a surface by tracing the path of a curve along another path curve.
Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) a curve.Select the path curve.Your browser does not support the video tag.Note
If the curve is not planar, then it will be extruded in the z&#160;direction of the active viewport's construction plane. If the curve is planar, it will be extruded in the normal direction of the plane of the curve.Unlike [Lofts](loft.html) and [Sweeps](sweep1.html), the initial orientation of the profile curve or surface is maintained through the extrusion.If the input is a non-planar polycurve or a planar polycurve where the extrusion direction is not normal to the curve plane, the result will be a [polysurface](polysurface.html) rather than an [extrusion object](useextrusions.html) .Command-line options
Solid
If the profile curve is closed and planar, both ends of the extruded object are filled with planar surfaces and joined to make a closed polysurface.
DeleteInput
Yes
Deletes the original geometry.
No
Retains the original geometry.
SubCurve
TheSubCurveoption extrudes a curve the distance specified by picking two points along a curve.
The extruded surface starts from the beginning of the curve, not the first picked point. Picking the points only establishes the extrusion distance.
Subcurve steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) the path curve. [Pick](pick-location.html) a start along the path curve.Pick an end along the path curve.Your browser does not support the video tag.SplitAtTangents
Yes
Creates a single surface.
No
Creates a polysurface when the input curves are joined tangent curves. Faces in the resulting polysurface correspond to the tangent sub-curves in the input curves.

Original polycurve (left), SplitAtTangents=No (center), SplitAtTangents=Yes (right).
Note
When this option is used, the output will be a polysurface.When [UseExtrusions](useextrusions.html) is on, this setting has no effect.See also
