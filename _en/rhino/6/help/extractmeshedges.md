The ExtractMeshEdges command separates edges from the parent mesh determined by an angle between mesh face normals.
The command may help if you have a mesh that came from a polysurface but no longer have the polysurface. Using the command with theUnweldedoption creates polyline approximations of where the edges of the polysurface were.
Note
Some STL/SLA printers have problems if meshes contain many long, thin facets. These can slow the printer's slicing process down, produce odd printed results, and run the printer out of memory.The [MeshRepair](meshrepair.html) command may be useful when tuning up meshes for STL/SLA printing.Steps
 [Select](select-objects.html) a mesh.Command-line options
Extract edges by
Unwelded
Extracts edges with coincident vertices.
Break angle
The angle between the face normals of adjacent faces.
Greater than
Specify a minimum break angle.
Select Edge
Specify an example edge to set the minimum break angle.
Less than
Specify a maximum break angle
Select Edge
Specify an example edge to set the maximum break angle.
Join results
Joins the resulting curves.

The ExtractNonManifoldMeshEdges command separates from the parent mesh non-manifold faces.
Nonmanifold edges
Edges of polysurfaces or meshes that have more than two faces joined to a single edge are non-manifold.
The illustration shows polysurfaces with non-manifold edges highlighted with the [ShowEdges](showedges.html) command.
