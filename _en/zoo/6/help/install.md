# Installation

To begin using the Zoo:

- The Zoo requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5
- [Download](http://wiki.mcneel.com/zoo/home) and install the Zoo on a Windows-based server or workstation.
- Make sure **TCP Port 80 (HTTP)** is open on any firewall software that is running on the server or workstation.
- Run the **Zoo Administrator (ZooAdmin.exe)** and add the license keys for Rhino or your Rhino-based products.
- Install Rhino or your Rhino-based products. During the installation, select **Network Node** as your license type and specify either the host name or IP address of your Zoo server.

If you already have Rhino installed, then launch Rhino and click **Tools → Options → Licenses**. Select your Rhino license and click **Convert**. Then, close Rhino and restart. At startup, select **Network Node** as your license type and specify either the host name or IP address of your Zoo server.

## Installing on the Server



##Installing on the Clients



## Moving the Zoo

Moving the Zoo license manager software from one server to another is really no different than installing the Zoo software from scratch.

Note, there is no way to “move” or “copy” McNeel product CD-Keys from one Zoo server to another. Product CD-Keys must be added to the new Zoo server just as you did with your original Zoo server.
