Sets the default time and number of passes constraints. These may be changed using the controls in the **Render Window.** 
Setting the **Number of passes** and **Time** to 0 allows the rendering to continue until you click **Stop Rendering**.

### Time
Specifies the amount of time in **Hours/Minutes/Seconds** the render will continue to process.
 **Note** : The rendering stops after the last pass after the time limit has been reached. If you click **Resume Rendering**, the rendering will continue for one additional pass.

### Number of passes
렌더링에서 진행되는 렌더링 패스의 수를 지정합니다.
 **Note** : Any time you click **Resume Rendering**, the counter for the number of passes is reset. For example, if you set the number of passes to 10 and stop the rendering after pass 8, the rendering will continue until it reaches 18 passes. If you allow the rendering to complete the 10 passes and then click Resume Rendering, the rendering will continue until it reaches 20 passes.
