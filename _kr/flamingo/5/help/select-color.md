The color selector is used for many material groups and properties.  In all cases, it works in a similar way.


There are two parts of the selector:

1. Drag the marker vertically in the inner square to define the brightness value.

##### Set in the Hue, Sat, Val boxes
1. Hue is a color's hue corresponds to its visible wavelength of light. Hue is measured in degrees from 0 to 359, which correspond roughly with a rainbow's hues in 60 degree increments: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.
1. Saturation refers to the color's intensity on a 0 to 100 scale. A saturation of 0 produces a neutral gray color that varies from black to white depending on the color's brightness. The hue has no effect on a color with a saturation component of 0. A saturation of 100 produces that hue's most intense shade.
1. Value refers to the perceived amount of light value (or white) in the color. The Value component varies between 0 and 100. Value is also sometimes referred to as luminance or brightness.
